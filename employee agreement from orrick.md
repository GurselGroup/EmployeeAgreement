>**1) Duties and Scope of Employment.**

>>**(a) Position.**  For the term of your employment under this Agreement (your “Employment”), the Company agrees to employ you in the position of [Title] [or in such other position as the Company subsequently may assign to you].  You will report to the Company’s [Board of Directors / CEO / CFO / CTO] [or to such other person as the Company subsequently may determine].

You will perform the duties and have the responsibilities and authority customarily performed and held by an employee in your position or as otherwise may be assigned or delegated to you by the Company’s [Board of Directors / CEO / CFO / CTO] [, including but not limited to _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ]. 

>>**(b) Obligations to the Company.**  During your Employment, you shall devote your full business efforts and time to the Company.  During your Employment, without the prior written approval of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, [which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,] you shall not render services in any capacity to any other person or entity and shall not act as a sole proprietor or partner of any other person or entity or own more than five percent of the stock of any other corporation.  [Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements, teach at educational institutions, or manage personal investments without such advance written consent, provided that such activities do not individually or in the aggregate interfere with the performance of your duties under this Agreement.]  You shall comply with the Company’s policies and rules, as they may be in effect from time to time during your Employment. 

>>**(c) No Conflicting Obligations.**  You represent and warrant to the Company that you are under no obligations or commitments, whether contractual or otherwise, that are inconsistent with your obligations under this Agreement.  In connection with your Employment, you shall not use or disclose any trade secrets or other proprietary information or intellectual property in which you or any other person has any right, title or interest and your Employment will not infringe or violate the rights of any other person.

Such [monthly] / [annual] salary shall be payable in accordance with the Company’s standard payroll procedures.  The annual compensation specified in this subsection (a), together with any modifications in such compensation that the Company may make from time to time, is referred to in this Agreement as “Base Salary.”  [The Board or any Compensation Committee of the Board shall review your Base Salary at least annually.  Effective as of the date of any change to your Base Salary, the Base Salary as so changed shall be considered the new Base Salary for all purposes of this Agreement.]  

>>**(b) [Incentive Bonuses.**  You will be eligible to be considered for an annual incentive bonus each calendar year during the term of your employment under this Agreement based upon the achievement of certain objective or subjective criteria established by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) or any Compensation Committee of the Board.  The target amount for any such annual incentive bonus will be up to _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ % of your Base Salary.  The determinations of the Board with respect to such bonus shall be final and binding.  You shall not earn an incentive bonus unless you are employed by the Company on the date when such bonus is payable.]
  
>>**(c) [Signing Bonus.**  The Company shall pay you a signing bonus of $_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  (the “Signing Bonus”) on or about the first day of your Employment, net of all applicable withholding taxes and other applicable deductions in accordance with the Company’s standard payroll practices.]  

>>**(d) [Up-Front Retention Bonus.**  The Company shall pay you a retention bonus of $_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  (the “Retention Bonus”) on or about the first day of your Employment, net of all applicable withholding taxes and other applicable deductions in accordance with the Company’s standard payroll practices.  You will earn and be permitted to retain the full amount of the Retention Bonus if you are employed by the Company on the _ _ _ _ -month anniversary of this Agreement.  If you resign from the Company before such time, you will be required to immediately return the gross pre-tax amount of the Retention Bonus to the Company.]  

>>**(e) [Relocation.**  In order to assist you to move yourself and your household from _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  to the San Francisco Bay Area, the Company will reimburse you up to an amount that will not exceed $_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  to cover your actual relocation expenses incurred for the following items:  closing costs on the sale of your home in _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , transportation from _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  to the San Francisco Bay Area, storage of household goods and temporary housing in the San Francisco Bay Area (the “Relocation Payment”).  The Relocation Payment shall be made to you net of all applicable withholding taxes and other applicable deductions in accordance with the Company’s standard payroll practices.]  [You will earn and be permitted to retain the full amount of the Relocation Payment if you are employed by the Company on the _ _ _ _ -month anniversary of this Agreement.  If you resign from the Company before such time, you will be required to immediately return the gross pre-tax amount of the Relocation Payment to the Company.]  

>>**(f) [Sales Compensation.**  In addition to your Base Salary, you are eligible to participate in the Company’s [Sales Incentive Plan Name],(the “Sales Incentive Plan”), subject to your execution of an acknowledgment of the terms of your participation in the Sales Incentive Plan (such form will be included in the plan documents which will be provided to you shortly).]

The Option shall be granted as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement or, if later, the date you commence fulltime Employment.  The exercise price per share will be equal to the fair market value per share on the date the Option is granted, as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors in good faith compliance with applicable guidance in order to avoid having the Option be treated as deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  There is no guarantee that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with this value.  You should consult with your own tax advisor concerning the tax risks associated with accepting an option to purchase the Company’s Common Stock.  [The term of the Option shall be 10 years], subject to earlier expiration in the event of the termination of your services to the Company.  [The Option shall be immediately exercisable, but the purchased shares shall be subject to repurchase by the Company at the exercise price in the event that your services to the Company terminate before the purchased shares become vested.]  So long as your service status is continuous, the Option shall vest [and become exercisable] as follows:  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  of the total number of option shares shall vest [and become exercisable] on [Date] and 1/48th of the total Option shares shall vest [and become exercisable] in equal monthly installments thereafter.  The Option will be an incentive stock option to the maximum extent allowed by the tax code and shall be subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in the Company’s [Stock Plan Name],(the “Stock Plan”) and in the Company's standard form of Stock Option Agreement (the “Stock Agreement”).]

In order to be eligible for such acceleration of vesting benefit, you must execute the Company’s standard form of release of all claims agreement.

In order to be eligible for such acceleration of vesting benefit, you must execute the Company’s standard form of release of all claims agreement.

The acceleration of vesting and lapse of repurchase rights provided for in the previous sentence shall occur immediately prior to the effective date of termination of your Continuous Service Status.  In order to be eligible for such acceleration of vesting benefit, you must execute the Company’s standard form of release of all claims agreement.
